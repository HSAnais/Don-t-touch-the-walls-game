# Don-t-touch-the-walls-game
An high school project made entirely in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio. A game in which the user advances with its mouse. In order to proceed to next levels, the player has to move the mouse on the playground in such a way it doesn't touch the walls. The difficulty increases with each level.
